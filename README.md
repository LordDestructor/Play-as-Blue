# Play as Blue! - WIP
Seems like Pokémon Blue Version is missing something?

Well, this patch makes you feel more like Blue, the most powerful trainer in the world.

You will become like him instead of Red's Character Sprite.

OPTIMIZED FOR EMULATORS: You can get all 151 Pokémon without trading.

Starters in Blue are: Eevee, Charmander and Squirtle.

Which Red choose as a starter? What will be Red's Team in the Indigo League?

Find out now!

There is a known issues:
- When selecting a Pokémon, Professor Oak's speech doesn’t match due to different starters.

Not compatible with (other hacks):
- Pokémon Polished Blue
- Pokered Spaceworld Backsprites
